    <h1>Hacker News Reader is Permanently Offline</h1>
    <p>
      Several months ago a header was added to all Hacker News pages that prohibited them
      from being rendered from within an iframe. Since hacker news reader was built
      around the use of an iframe, it no longer works as I originally intended and have
      therefore decided to shut the app down.
